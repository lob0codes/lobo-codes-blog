### Advanced TypeScript Concepts

TypeScript offers advanced features that go beyond basic syntax and type checking. Understanding these concepts can help you write more robust and maintainable code.

#### Generics

Generics allow you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that work with a variety of data types while maintaining type safety. Here's an example of a generic function:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

const result = identity<string>("TypeScript");
console.log(result);
```

```

```
